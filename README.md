### Contributions are warmly welcomed ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Getting Started üöÄ

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to be installed on your computer.
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio-template
```

If you don't have Git installed or you don't like using the terminal then you can download the [zip](https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio-template/archive/master.zip) and extract that and open the extracted folder in the code editor of your your choice.

## Editing the Template üî®

Go to `index.html` and fill your information.

### Header

In all of the places where you're supposed to fill your information you'll find HTML comments. As shown below just replace what is already in the opening and closing tags below the comment with your information.

```html
<div class="header__text-box row">
    <div class="header__text">
        <h1 class="heading-primary">
        <!-- Replace the following name with your name -->
        <span>Matthew Doak</span>
        </h1>
        <!-- Put a small paragraph about yourself -->
        <p>A Web Developer based in Austin, TX.</p>
        <a href="#contact" class="btn btn--pink">Get in touch</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Work Section

Each div with class `work__box` represents a project, replace the contents of the all the tags with the information of your projects.

```html
<div class="work__box">
    <div class="work__text">
    <h3>Portfolio Template</h3>
    <p>
        A free Open Source Portfolio for anyone to use for free.
    </p>
    <ul class="work__list">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>SCSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Parcel</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="work__links">
        <a href="#" class="link__text">
        Visit Site <span>&rarr;</span>
        </a>
        <a href="https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio" target="_blank">
        <img src="./images/github.svg" class="work__code" alt="GitHub">
        </a>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="work__image-box">
        <img
            src="./images/project-1.png"
            class="work__image"
            alt="Project 1"
        />
    </div>
</div>
```

For changing the screenshot:
- first place the image in `images/` folder and then in HTML replace the name in `src` with the name of your image.

- Recommended size for project image (1366 x 767px) also make sure the size of all  project images is the same.

```html
<img
    src="./images/name-of-your-image.png"
    class="work__image"
    alt="Project 1"
/>
```

### Clients Section

- Place the logos of the clients and companies that you have worked with in `images/` directory and then replace the name in `src` with the name of your logos accordingly.

- Make sure that you don't have whitespace on either side of the logos.

```html
<img
    src="./images/your-logo.png"
    class="client__logo"
    alt="Your Logo"
/>
```

### About Section

- Replace the contents in the below paragraph with information about yourself.
- Place a nice photo of yourself in the `images/` directory and then change the name in the src with your image name.

                nostrum illo harum blanditiis, tenetur eum suscipit cupiditate
                in vel, ex quam quidem quos mollitia labore aut sunt eius
                ratione molestiae fuga veniam facere similique voluptate.
                </p>
                <!-- Provide a link to your resume -->
                <a href="#" class="btn">My Resume</a>
            </div>

            <div class="about__photo-container">
                <!-- Add a nice photo of yourself -->
                <img
                class="about__photo"
                src="./images/syed-ali-hussnain.jpg"
                alt=""
                />
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

            represent your product or business? or looking for any kind of
            consultation? or want to ask questions? or have some advice for me
            or just want to say "Hi üëã" in any case feel free to Let me know. I
            will do my best to respond back. üòä The quickest way to reach out to

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
